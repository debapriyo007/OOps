# Notes ðŸ”¥

Compile the java code we need a tool that tool is `JDK`
##  JDK 

- JDK is stand for `Java Development Kit`
- Why do we need JDK ?
- As a developer when you type a code we have to convert that code into `Byte Code` 
  the code which is run on the mechine that's  `Bytes Code`

#### **ðŸ¤“ Concept is - You type java code and you will compiler it that will convert into `Byte Code` which is run on a machine**
  
- The Machie is `JVM (Java Vartual Machine)`

##  JVM 
- Like you have to successfully compile the java code into byte Code , 
  now you have to run that code or excute the code , it's needs some space 
  that is called `JVM`.

- Why this is called `JVM` ?
-  We have a machine to make the java Plartfrom independent we went for a  voritual layer top of it.
  which machine you have JVM you run the java code.


##  JRE 
- JRE is stand for `Java Runtime Enviroment`

- Suppose you have create a java file and write down java code and you java code need some
external file apart form you file that you have created . You have use some inbuild classes
and libaries that's why we need some extra thing here mens, extra file classes , packages ,
libaries that's why one extra layer here which is your `JRE`

- It a also validate your `Byte Code`.

### Beauty is : `JVM IS PART OF JRE`


- ### `JDK IS THE UPPERLAYER OR SAY TOP LAYER WHEN YOU INSTALL JDK YOU WILL GET UPDATED JRE AS WELL AS JVM`

- ### `BY DEFAULT OR THE CLINT MACHINE YOU WILL FIND JRE AND JVM WHICH HAVE EXTRAL FILE AND YOU HAVE RUN THE CODE`
