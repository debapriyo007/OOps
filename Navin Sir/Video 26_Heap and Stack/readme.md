# Stack and Heap In Java ðŸ¤“

What Happen when you create a Varriable or Store a Varriable ?
- Inside `JVM ` memory , we catagorize into two part -- 
1. Stack 
2. Heap


### Stack 
- This is the area when we can store the data which is LIFO.
- That is Stack memory.
- Here we basically store the Data in different sequence.


### Heap 

- This is Heap Memory
- This is Open-Space.

## `Every Methord has his Own Stack ðŸ™„`
- `STACK HAS ALWAYS BE A KEY VALUE PAIR! ðŸ™„ `
