## Access Modifiers

Access modifiers in OOPS determine the visibility and accessibility of class members (variables and methods). They help in controlling the access to sensitive data and functionality within a class or across different classes and packages.

The following table summarizes the different access modifiers and their visibility:

| Access Modifier | Within Class | Within Package | Same Package by Subclasses | Outside Package by Subclasses |
|-----------------|--------------|----------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Private         | ✔            | ❌              | ❌                          | ❌                             |
| Default         | ✔            | ✔              | ✔                          | ❌                             |
| Protected       | ✔            | ✔              | ✔                          | ✔                             |
| Public          | ✔            | ✔              | ✔                          | ✔                             |

### Private Access Modifier

The `private` access modifier restricts the visibility of a member to only within the same class. It is used to encapsulate sensitive data or implementation details that should not be accessed or modified from outside the class.

### Default Access Modifier

The default access modifier (also known as package-private or package-level access) allows access to members within the same package. It is used when you want to share members between classes within the same package but restrict access from classes outside the package.

### Protected Access Modifier

The `protected` access modifier allows access to members within the same class, same package, and subclasses (even if they are in a different package). It is used when you want to provide access to subclasses for inheritance purposes while still restricting access from classes outside the package.

### Public Access Modifier

The `public` access modifier allows unrestricted access to members from anywhere. It is used when you want to make a member accessible to all classes and packages.

Happy coding!
